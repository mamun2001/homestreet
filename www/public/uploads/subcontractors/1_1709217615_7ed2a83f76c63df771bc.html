ms-access in a multi-user mode.</font></p>
        <p>By Albert D. Kallal<br><em>Friday, August 19, 2005</em></p> 
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">One of the neat 
        things about ms-access is that you can take an application you written, 
        and turn it into a multi-user application without having to change code.
        </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Before we actually get into 
how to split a database and use ms-access in a muti-user mode, I want to clear 
up in your mind as to what this split idea is all about. Once this concept of a 
split database is clear in your mind, then the “why” we split will become also 
clear. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;The first thing to realize 
when using access is that you are using a tool that creates software. This is a 
VERY important concept here. When you use other parts of office such as word, or 
Excel you are using an application that creates documents. So, with word, you 
have an application part called the word program (or so called executable).&nbsp; 
After you LOAD the program called "word"&nbsp;you THEN can consume word documents. 
The same goes for Excel, you launch Excel, AND THEN open a document designed for 
that application. And, not to split hairs, but when you browse through a bunch 
of folders and then finally click on a word document you found, what actually 
occurs is the APPLICATION part loads first, and THEN the document part is 
consumed by the program part.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;The very simple, but 
important concept here is that software generally has two parts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font size="4">1 - &nbsp;The program part, or 
software part</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font size="4">2 -&nbsp;The data part.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Some of you are wondering 
why the above simple and important concept needs to be pointed out? It turns out 
that a good number of systems administers and general users of computers have 
NOT thought about this common concept in software. It is not a hard concept to 
grasp that software has a data part + application part. In most organizations, 
installing the software on EACH desktop computer is not even given a second 
thought. So, if you want to use word, you install word on EACH computer. If you 
want to use Excel, then again, it is common knowledge, and common sense that you 
install the application on the workstation. Often, you will share some documents 
on a server, and allow users to open those documents. Note carefully how even in 
this case, the software (application part) is STILL INSTALLED on the 
workstation. Sure, you can put the DATA PART, or so called document part on a 
shared server folder. However, you STILL installed the software part on each 
computer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">So, for a typical network 
when you share data, you have one computer that is your server, and you share 
folders to computers on your network.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">In the above example, 
applications on each workstation can open their respective documents (data 
parts) that are placed on the server.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">There are good many reasons 
as to why we install the software part on EACH workstation. A few reasons are:</span></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">The software now does not 
  have to travel across the network each time it is used. It would be a waste of 
  network resources if applications such as word etc. had to be loaded across 
  the network and use up precious network bandwidth. Remember, networks are MUCH 
  slower then your hard disk to load files. Remember, the network is a shared 
  resource. If&nbsp;you have two users on the network pulling data, then you have 1/2 
  the amount of resources available. You must treat your network with the utmost 
  respect, as it is a delicate and precious (limited) resource. When you have 4 
  people on the same network, you have 1/4 the amount of performance. You MUST 
  thus be very careful. Imagine how slow things would be if all users loaded 
  their software from the network each time? <br>
  &nbsp;</span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">If one user makes a 
  change to their printer setup or just a general change to their settings, they 
  have their OWN copy of the application to play with, and NOT interfere with 
  other users on the network. Can you imagine two users fighting over how their 
  excel sheet should be laid out at the same time!!<br>
  &nbsp;</span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">If a user's software 
  crashes, then no other users are affected. Can you imagine if word were to 
  freeze up, or lock on your computer and everyone else in the building also 
  experienced a freeze up or lock up. Again, it makes sense to install the 
  application part on each pc as to ISOLATE individual’s problems that might 
  occur in the application. So, installing software on each PC is a MUST DO from 
  a reliability point of view. You don't want to allow ONE user's problem to 
  become the problem of everyone else. This is again why we split a database in 
  ms-access in multi-user mode (otherwise you will get NO reliability).</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">I could add MANY more 
reasons to the above list, but suffice to say that it makes a lot of sense to 
install the software on each computer. I don’t think there are too many people 
that have trouble understanding the above concepts. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">However, when it comes to 
ms-access, the above concepts for some strange reason are complete ignored. 
Users all of a sudden get some type of freeze in the brain, and all of a sudden 
compete ignore how they deployed software on their computers for that last 15 
years!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Ok, so what do applications 
and the data part that applications consume have to do with ms-access? It turns 
out that ms-access is MUCH more then just a data file. Ms-access is a software 
development tool. You might write a letter in word, but in ms-access in addition 
to typing in data, or text like word, you ALSO CREATE SOFTWARE. When you start 
using ms-access, then you have to put on a developers hat, and begin to think 
from a developer point of view.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">You can use many different 
kinds of tools to create software with. These tools like c++, VB, and yes even 
ms-access are used to build forms (the user interface part), and also write 
code. These forms + code are what we call an application. It is this application 
part that you create that needs to be installed on each computer. &nbsp;You always 
installed the word application on your computer. So, now that YOU ARE writing 
software, why should you throw out all of the ideas and concepts as to how 
software works on your computer? You can use a software tool like VB to create a 
word processing application, and once done, you will install that application on 
each computer. I should point out that you can also use ms-access to create a 
word processor, or a Pac man game. Make no mistake here; ms-access is a tool 
that allows you to create software. After you create that software, you need to 
install that software on EACH computer like you done with everything else you 
used.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">The concept of splitting a 
database.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Ms-access is a most 
interesting software development tool. Access lets you build software, and ALSO 
keep the document part, or what we have been calling the data part in ONE FILE. 
This feature is really handy since you have ONE file that is both application 
part + data part. For a single user, this setup is very handy. Another nice 
feature of having data + application in one part is that you don’t have to think 
about all the above software concepts when working on your application. I mean, 
one part is easier then two parts to deal with!! </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">This also why so many 
budding developers start out using ms-access, as it saves people having to think 
about the concept of a application part and a data part.&nbsp; I do believe that most 
users can grasp the concept that Excel is an application, and that excel 
consumes a data part (a document part if you are thinking in terms of word, or 
excel). These same concepts must be applied when you create an ms-access 
application.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Further, the instant you go 
multi-user, then having two parts (data part + application part) becomes an 
advantage. The reasons are mostly the same as why all other applications on your 
computer split into two parts in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Ms-access has a splitter 
tool built in. From the main menu go;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">After you run the splitter,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">If you look at the above, 
the ONLY new concept you have here is linked tables. Everything else in your 
application will function as before. Splitting a database is thus easy, and 
requites little or no effort on your part. The only extra issue here to deal 
with is what we call linked tables. Now when you work with your application, all 
tables will be placed in the data only part. This data only file is commonly 
referred to as the back end (BE). If you add new fields to a table, modify the 
table designs, or add new tables, you MUST do all of this modifying and changing 
in the BE (data only file). You will NOT make table (structure) changes in the 
application part (FE). In fact, if you try to make a change to design of a table 
in the application part, you will find it is not possible! The application part 
is what is commonly referred to as the front end (FE).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">What is now interesting 
about the above setup is you can make a copy of BOTH the FE, and the BE. You can 
even switch what BE the FE is connected to. This means you can test on test 
data, or test dangerous deleting code on a test BE. When you are happy that the 
test was ok, then you switch the connection back to the live, or production BE.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">To switch, or manage the 
connection you use what is called the linked table manager in ms-access. You 
will no doubt become quite familiar with this linking process as you will now 
use the linked table manager to change what BE the FE connects to. Changing the 
connection will thus become part of your development routine, and is second 
nature to any experienced access developer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">The linked table manger in 
a2003 can be found via:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools-&gt;database 
utilities -&gt; Linked Table manager</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Note that once you linked 
that FE to the BE, that link remains in effect. You can now copy the front end 
to a different location, but the linked connection will STILL continue to be 
pointing to that BE part. This means you have to use caution here. I worked on a 
copy of the FE, before working on this copy, I of course use the linked table 
manager to link the FE to a test copy of the BE. I am now able to test, delete, 
enter records and write new code etc. in this FE. This testing, and entering of 
test data etc. does not effect the users since their FE are linked to the 
production, or so called "live" BE. When I am done making changes to my FE, I 
can then re-deploy the FE to all the users on the network. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION! 
Note that before I deploy the new FE&nbsp;to each computer I MUST REMEMBER to 
re-connect the FE to the correct BE! I will admit that I have messed this 
process up once. The results are very nasty, as now all uses when they run the 
FE are connected to the WRONG BE. Any new data they enter will go into the test 
BE, and trying to sort this mess out and move new data from the test BE to the 
production BE is a nightmare. So, use caution here, and MAKE DOUBLE sure you 
connected the FE to the correct BE when you deploy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">One last thing about linking 
the FE to the BE is that you need to always use what is called UNC path names 
(Universal Naming Convention). All this really means is that you REALLY REALLY 
REALLY do not want to use mapped drive letters when you link. Besides, mapped 
letters are a 20 year throwback to the old PC DOS and CPM days when we used 
floppy disks! (When is the last time you used a floppy disk). Don't use mapped 
drives to a file share on the server. Drive mappings have all kinds of problems. 
Just plugging in a USB jump drive (memory stick) into your computer and the 
drive mappings can change. Further, you have to setup EACH pc for drive mappings 
and that is a pain. Further, even plugging in a digital camera can change drive 
letters. So, just avoid drive letters and mapping like the plague. Simply put, 
don't use them, and they are horrible from a support point of view. If you do 
risk using drive letters, then you will get a large increase in support calls 
for your software. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">In other words, always use a 
path name to the back end files. What this means is when you use the linked 
table manger, always navigate through network places to the server, and then to 
the folder, and then the back end mdb file. DO NOT use mapped drives, and do NOT 
use the linked table manager to navigate to a back end by a drive letter.&nbsp; If 
you use a mapped drive, then your path name will be something like:</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
<a href="file:///E:/mydata/backend.mdb">e:\mydata\backend.mdb</a></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">If you 
navigate by the network places, you will get a path name that does NOT have a 
drive letter. The path name (UNC) will look like</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
<a href="file://servername/mydata/backend.mdb">\\servername\mydata\backend.mdb</a></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">One last tip:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often after splitting 
some people find the performance is horrible! To restore the performance make 
sure that you FE in the startup opens up a table to the back end, and KEEPS it 
open. By keeping open a persistent connection, then the VERY slow connection 
process only occurs once.&nbsp; If you don't want add code to the FE to&nbsp;open a table, 
you can create a small form in the FE that is attached to a table in the BE (you 
then minimize it, or even set it to invisible). Either way,&nbsp;you ALWAYS want to 
ensue that the FE has a connection to the BE in this fashion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">To be fair, this system of 
linked tables is little BIT more work. For example, now to add a table, you will 
have to open the BE, add your table. Close the BE. You now have to open the FE, 
and add a linked table to application that points to that new table. To add this 
linked table to the FE,&nbsp;you would go to the regular table tab where we always 
added a table. We then go new (for a new table), and select ---&gt; link table (in 
place of design view). Since this is a few extra steps and hassle, often a 
developer will wait until a considerable amount of time has passed before 
splitting a database. It makes no sense if you don't have any users, and have 
not even deployed the application for multi-user mode to split. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Users often ask at what 
point in the development process do you split? Well, the answer is you just 
know!! At the start of the development process, you are creating tables left and 
right. And, further, at the start you have no users! After a considerable amount 
of time, that table creating process settles down to a dull roar. In fact, after 
a certain amount of time, if you are still adding tables to your application at 
a high rate, then something is wrong with the design. So, as&nbsp;you near the time 
when other users will start to use the application, then that is likely when you 
will split. And, hopefully by that time, adding new tables will now occur at a 
very much reduce rate. Thus the extra work of using linked tables will be of a 
minimal cost in terms of time and effort. Note that once you split, you don't as 
a rule un-split.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Compiling your 
application before you install on each pc. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">At this point, you could 
deploy your FE to each workstation. However,&nbsp;you should not deploy something 
that users can change, mess with or modify to cause damage to your application, 
or worse the data! So, as a general rule, right before you deploy the 
application to your users, you compile the FE mdb into an mde file (the "e" 
stands for executable). This process of compiling removes all source code, 
strips out extra debugging stuff, and freezes the design of the mde. It is this 
mde that you should deploy to each workstation. That mde design can't be changed 
by your users. It is also the way developers deploy applications to clients, but 
those clients can't change the application.&nbsp; When you create an mde, then the 
version of ms-access you have installed on the target pc in effect becomes your 
runtime support files. Note that VB, or even&nbsp;VB.net applications will not run on 
your pc unless you have the supporting runtime libraries installed. In our case, 
that means you need ms-access installed to make the mde (or any mdb for that 
matter) work on the target pc. While in most cases we assume that ms-access is 
already installed on the target pc, do note that you can also purchase a royalty 
free runtime system that allows you to package ms-access with your mde. This 
developer’s edition of ms-access thus allows for deployment on computers that 
have not purchased a copy of ms-access. Regardless of the royalty free runtime 
edition, or regular edition of ms-access, you should create the mde for 
deployment. Both editions can create mde files, and thus you should give users 
an mde.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">From the menu go;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Tools-&gt;database 
utilities-&gt;make mde file</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">(Note: that while versions 
of ms-access can often open, and use different versions of ms-access, to create 
an mde your mdb file MUST BE in the SAME version as access you are using. So, 
access 2003&nbsp;can open, and work with a2000, and a2002 files, but to create an mde, 
you MUST use an mdb file of the SAME version of access that you are running. So, 
to create an mde in a2003, the mdb file must be also that version). This means 
you can't use access 2003 to create an mde for access 97 (however, access 2003 
can create an access 97 mdb file...just not an mde one).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Even if issues of users 
changing the code, or you as developer don't care to protect your code, you 
REALLY still should deploy the mde. The mde is the end results of your 
application and is designed to be deployed to users. Further, this mde is 
smaller, runs faster, and is also more reliable (can't come un-compiled, or be 
modified by your users). To be fair, users can modify quires, but the forms, and 
code, and reports (the application) cannot be changed. Use caution when you make 
a mde, as you MUST keep the original mdb for further development&nbsp;(you cannot 
reverse this process!!). So, you deploy this mde to your users..and continue to 
work on the mdb. It probably don't need pointing out, but a mde that is not 
split is of little use, since you can't modify the forms, and if you deploy a 
un-split mde to your users, you will NOT be able to update the forms, reports, 
code etc. because you also have the data tables with the application part.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">As a general rule, when you 
deploy the mde to each user’s workstation, you will (or should) provide a 
shortcut on the desktop (and an entry in the start menu doesn’t hurt either). 
Remember that part about you thinking like a developer here! I mean, how do you 
expect the user to launch your application? So, just like every other 
application, you should provide a shortcut on the desktop for ease of use to 
launch your application. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">And, while we are at this, 
you do need to come up with a directory or location where you install this mde 
application on the user’s workstation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
<a href="file:///C:/program">c:\program</a> files\Your application dir\CustomersMailingList.mde</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">However, in many cases, some 
companies are now locking down their pc's very tight, and the program dir's are 
now often read only, and we need read/write for our mde file. So, the best 
location (at least for windows xp) is to use:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">C:\Documents and 
Settings\All Users\Application Data</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">So, for our above 
application, I would likely use the following directory.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">C:\Documents and 
Settings\All Users\Application Data\Custmailing\CustomersMailingList.mde</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Of course, we don't want the 
user to have browse through all those directories just to launch the application 
(you don't do that to launch word etc, but provide a shortcut).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">So, you need to create a 
shortcut on the desktop. Just right click on any blank area in desktop, and 
select new-&gt;shortcut. This process is easy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">The most common complaint 
about splitting is now you have to go around and install a new FE each time you 
make a change. The benefits of splitting far outweigh this ONE problem. And, the 
solution here is to either roll your own code to check for&nbsp;a new version and 
copy it from the server directory where the BE resides. That is what I do in my 
startup code, and it was only a few hours of work. A better and commercial grade 
solution is to grab Tony's free FE updater, this little gem simply updates your 
new FE to all users on the network when you place a new version in the directory 
where the BE is. It is a gem, and can be found here:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">The above concepts will now 
allow you to safely work on the next great release of your software. Further, by 
adopting the standard way you installed all other programs on your computer, you 
also ensue a reliable operation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Trying to work on an 
application and dance around users at the same time is like working on an 
airplane while it is in flight. It is really hard to imagine how anyone can 
develop an application that is un-split. Since users can't work while you modify 
an un-split application, then does everyone get to go home while you work? What 
happen when you make a simple coding mistake and then damage all of the 
production data? It is simply too dangerous to work on the actual code while 
users are running the application. Further, if&nbsp;you break something while users 
are working with your application, then those users likely will not want to use 
your software. Damaging user confidence&nbsp;can often result in people not wanting 
to use your software. Don’t underestimate how user frustration can kill your 
project. If your users get discouraged, then often your project will fail. 
Remember, you now have to wear the developer’s hat here!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">So, split your application 
and develop in peace, and with peace of mind. Split your application so you 
don't drag it across the precious network. And, split your application&nbsp;so it 
runs reliably.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">I also have a few notes 
AFTER my signature in this article that follow on using a security workgroup 
file, but you can ignore this info if you are not using a workgroup security 
file.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">One last note:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">Using a mdb file across a poor connection 
can damage (corrupt) a mdb file. I explain WHY a mdb file can corrupt in the 
following article, and also explain why you can't use a split database on a 
wireless network.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Specify options, and 
the security file in the shortcut.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">While the linked table 
manager allows you to setup the connection (link) to the BE, you have no such 
luck when you are using a security workgroup file. So,&nbsp;if you are going to setup 
security, and have users/logons etc. for the database, then you need to place 
the workgroup file on the server. In these case, that security workgroup file 
should be placed in the SAME location (directory) as the BE resides. What this 
means is that your shortcut on the desktop needs to tell ms-access WHERE (more 
specially what) workgroup file to use. Unfortunately, to specify a workgroup 
file, your shortcut must now point to the msaccess.exe on your workstation, and 
the backend file, and the workgroup file! (You need to specify all 3 in that 
shortcut!). This file path will vary from version to version of ms-access. For 
access 2003 an example shortcut for the above mde file would thus be:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">"<a href="file:///C:/Program%20Files/Microsoft%20Office/OFFICE11/MSACCESS.EXE" style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#000000">C:\Program 
Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11\MSACCESS.EXE</font></a>"</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;"C:\Documents 
and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Custmailing\CustomersMailingList.mde"</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;/wrkgrp "\\servername\shardFolder\custordata\<a href="file:///C:/Program%20Files/RidesXP/Rides.mdw">mailing.mdw</a>"</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">Of course, the above goes 
all on one line. In the shortcut properties 'target' (each part is separated by 
a space). Note that you could deploy the workgroup file to each workstation 
also, but then that would not allow you to add new users, or change passwords 
without re-deploying this data file. And, since the workgroup file is just a 
data file, then it should be shared to all users, and the sensible place is thus 
the same location as the BE.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:13.5pt">During development, I get so 
tired to typing in the password, that I often make a shortcut on my computer 
that supplies the admin user and the password so I don't have to type it each 
time. So, add to the above shortcut:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;/User "Admin" /pwd 
"mypassword"</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The above also lets 
me work on different projects during the day, and each shortcut thus selects the 
workgroup file. And, for the many regular mdb files that don't have security, 
then no prompts occur since using a shortcut means I do NOT have to join a 
workgroup file.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Of course, all this 
setup stuff really means that you should start setting up some install scripts, 
and that means you want to consider using some install tools.&nbsp; That is a 
whole another topic, and another future article!</font></p>
